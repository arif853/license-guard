# License Guard for Laravel

Protect your Laravel application from unauthorized usage with remote license validation.

This package integrates a middleware that checks a license key and domain against a remote server before allowing access to the application.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Remote license verification via HTTP request
- Domain-bound license enforcement
- Caching to reduce server calls
- Middleware protection at route or global level
- Auto-registration via service provider

---

## 📦 Installation

1. **Add repository to your Laravel project:**

In your Laravel project’s `composer.json`:

```json
"repositories": [
  {
    "type": "vcs",
    "url": "https://github.com/arif853/license-guard"
  }
]
````

2. **Install via Composer:**

```bash
composer require arif853/license-guard
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

3. **Publish the config file (optional):**

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=config
```

This will create `config/license-guard.php`.

4. **Set your environment values in `.env`:**

```env
LICENSE_GUARD_KEY=your-license-key
LICENSE_GUARD_VERIFY_URL=https://your-license-server.com/api/verify-license
```

Make sure your license server supports `GET` with `key` and `domain` parameters.

## 🔐 Middleware Usage

### Option 1: Apply Middleware Manually


Then in `app/Http/Kernel.php`:

```php
protected $middlewareGroups = [
    'web' => [
        // other middleware...
        'license.guard',
    ],
];
```
